    <h1>Hey, nice to meet ya!</h1>
    <hr>
    My name is Olivia Riddoch and I’m a junior at Syracuse University studying Creative Advertising at the S.I. Newhouse School of
    Public Communications and Information Management & Technology at the iSchool. I love to
    combine technology and art to create impactful messages. At Syracuse I have intensely studied
    technical design skills including the Adobe Suite as well as the extensive process of researching
    audiences and media planning. I can use databases like MRI Simmons and GWI to study
    audiences and come to conclusions about their media preferences. <a rel="resume" href="#resume">Check out my resume below!</a>

        When I’m not in class, I’m usually at a TNH or Ski Club event! TNH is the top advertising club in
    the country for college media creation. We take on real clients and produce professional,
    strategic material. In the past I have worked with Heritage Cafe and Luna Cat Cafe all based in
    Syracuse. The Syracuse Ski Club is where the cold Syracuse winters get put to good use. I ski
    twice a week at local mountains and take occasional weekend trips. I have met the best people
    and had amazing experiences.

    In addition to my crazy schedule I love to take on personal creative projects when I have the
    time. I have been loving sewing and gaining so much knowledge in the past couple of months. I
    love the technical skill and math knowledge that sewing uses to create a one of one piece. Here are some of my recent works:
