        Hi!
My name is Olivia Riddoch and I am a junior Creative Advertising major interested in designing graphics and photo editing. I am a member of the Syracuse University Club Ski Team as well as TNH Advertising Club, the nation's top ranked student run advertising agency. Outside of school, I love to run, create art, and cook food for my friends and family.
